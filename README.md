# hello-world
My first time ver using GitHub

Hello Marc, hello Lukas.

Who am I?

Active, professional, curious, goal-oriented and reliable. Please read more about me on LinkedIn or XING. As a person I remained young, much younger than my age and IÂ´ll continue to shape my professional and private life for many more years to come. I have shown my independence in various functions, in many projects with national and international customers, and in particular in staffing and development of numerous Service teams in the BPO. And Scrum is part of my professional and private life successfully for many years.
